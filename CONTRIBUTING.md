## Guidelines

### General guidelines

- The main branch is what is deployed on Github pages.
- It's a very nice thing to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR. It's easier to review it. Then we will squash it before merging.
- Keep the project simple : we want to keep the dependencies minimal, hopefully none. This means no JS framework or build tools if we can avoid it.

### Adding new translation or having a suggestion

Ideally you should open a suggestion issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/zenika-open-source/clepsydre/issues).
